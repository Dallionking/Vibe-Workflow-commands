# TeamFlow - Project Specification

## Executive Summary

TeamFlow is a collaborative task management platform designed specifically for small business teams (5-50 employees). Unlike generic task management tools, TeamFlow combines task organization, team collaboration, and business intelligence in a single platform that speaks the language of small business owners.

**Mission**: Empower small business teams to work more efficiently and make data-driven decisions without the complexity and cost of enterprise solutions.

## Business Overview

### Problem Statement
Small businesses are caught in a productivity paradox. They need the organizational power of enterprise tools but lack the resources, time, and technical expertise to implement complex solutions. Current options force them to choose between:

1. **Simple tools** that become inadequate as they grow
2. **Complex tools** that overwhelm their teams and budgets
3. **Multiple tools** that fragment their workflow and data

**Result**: Teams spend 40% of their time managing tools instead of completing work, and business owners lack visibility into productivity and profitability.

### Solution Overview
TeamFlow bridges this gap with a platform that:
- **Feels simple** but scales with business growth
- **Integrates naturally** with existing small business tools
- **Provides insights** that directly impact the bottom line
- **Requires minimal training** and technical expertise
