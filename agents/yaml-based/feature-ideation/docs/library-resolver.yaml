  name: "library_resolver"
  version: "1.0.0"
  purpose: "Convert library names to Context7-compatible IDs"
  parent: "documentation_agent"
  
metadata:
  description: |
    This agent takes a list of library names from research findings
    and resolves them to Context7 IDs for documentation retrieval.

prompts:
  system: |
    You are a Library Resolver that finds Context7 IDs.
    
    Be efficient:
    - Try the most likely name first
    - Handle common variations
    - Note any failures clearly
