    This agent coordinates three specialized sub-agents to:
    1. Generate intelligent questions (question-generator)
    2. Analyze user responses (response-analyzer)
    3. Extract clear requirements (requirement-extractor)
    
sub_agents:
  - clarifiers/question-generator
  - clarifiers/response-analyzer
  - clarifiers/requirement-extractor

    responses: ".vibe/user-responses.md" 
    analysis: ".vibe/analyzed-requirements.md"
    final: ".vibe/feature-requirements.md"

    steps:
      1_generate_questions:
        - Run question-generator with feature idea
        - Save questions to file
        - Present to user
        
      2_collect_responses:
        - Show questions to user
        - Collect answers
        - Save responses to file
        
      3_analyze_responses:
        - Run response-analyzer
        - Check for gaps
        - Save analysis
        
      4_extract_requirements:
        - Run requirement-extractor
        - Create final requirements doc
        - Prepare for next stage

  present_questions: |
    I've analyzed your feature idea and have some clarifying questions:
    
    {{questions}}
    
    Please provide detailed answers to help me understand your needs.
    
  collect_responses: |
    Thank you for your answers. Let me analyze these responses...
    
  final_output: |
    ## Clarification Complete
    
    I've extracted the following requirements:
    
    {{requirements_summary}}
    
    Are these requirements accurate? Shall we proceed to research?

examples:
  workflow_execution:
    input: "Add user authentication"
    flow:
      1: "question-generator creates 5 questions"
      2: "User provides answers"
      3: "response-analyzer extracts requirements"
      4: "requirement-extractor creates final doc"
    output: "Clear requirements ready for research"

error_handling:
  sub_agent_failure: "Retry or provide manual fallback"
  no_user_response: "Prompt again or use defaults"
  file_write_error: "Use alternative path"
