   - For continuous monitoring (proactive assistance)

2. **Extracted Intelligence**: Learn from existing code and documentation:
   - Code patterns from actual implementations
   - Component structures from existing files
   - API patterns from current endpoints
   - Testing strategies from test files
   - Error handling from try-catch blocks

3. **Technical Architecture Decisions**: Why were these choices made:
   - Framework selections and justifications
   - Database design rationale
   - Service integration strategies
   - Performance optimization approaches
   - Security implementation patterns
