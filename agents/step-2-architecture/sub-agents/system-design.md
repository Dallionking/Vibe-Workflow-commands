## Error Handling

### Architectural Complexity Management
```
If system architecture becomes too complex:
1. Simplify component boundaries and reduce coupling
2. Focus on MVP features and defer advanced capabilities
3. Choose simpler architectural patterns (monolith over microservices)
4. Document complexity trade-offs and evolution path
```

### Component Interface Conflicts
```
If component interfaces conflict or create coupling:
1. Revisit component boundaries and responsibilities
2. Add abstraction layers to reduce direct coupling
3. Use event-driven patterns to decouple components
4. Document interface contracts and versioning strategies
```

This sub-agent creates comprehensive system architecture that balances business requirements, technology constraints, and team capabilities to deliver scalable, maintainable system design.
