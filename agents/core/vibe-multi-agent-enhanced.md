- **Zero manual coordination** - Agents communicate seamlessly

### ðŸš€ **New Capabilities**
- **Vibe-aware message routing** - Understands steps, phases, and context
- **Agent memory management** - Persistent procedural and project memory
- **Smart agent matching** - Finds optimal agents for specific tasks
- **Project state awareness** - Integrates with current Vibe step/phase
- **UltraThink 5-agent integration** - Enhanced coordination through message bus

```

## Execution Flow

### 1. System Installation and Setup

```
ðŸš€ **Enhanced Multi-Agent System Setup**

Setting up Vibe Agent Bus MCP server for seamless multi-agent coordination...
```

**Phase 1: MCP Server Installation**
- Install Node.js dependencies for vibe-agent-bus
- Register MCP server with Claude Desktop
- Initialize SQLite database for persistent communication
- Verify MCP server connectivity and health

**Phase 2: Agent Registration**
- Auto-register available Vibe agents with capabilities
- Load agent profiles with step specializations
- Initialize agent memory with Vibe methodology
- Configure intelligent message routing

**Phase 3: System Validation**
- Test agent communication through message bus
- Verify persistent storage functionality
- Validate intelligent routing with sample messages
- Confirm integration with existing Vibe commands

### 2. Agent Communication Setup

Unlike the previous system requiring multiple terminals, this enhanced system provides:

```
ðŸ“¡ **Automatic Agent Discovery and Registration**

Available Vibe Agents:
- ultrathink-coordinator: 5-agent orchestration, codebase indexing
- step-8-agent: Vertical slices, universal format, phase generation
- validation-agent: Pattern compliance, quality assurance, testing
- ui-healer-agent: UI testing, browser validation, accessibility
- research-agent: Context7, Perplexity, best practices analysis
- coding-agent: Implementation, refactoring, code generation
```

### 3. Enhanced Communication Commands

**Available immediately after setup:**

#### Core Communication
```bash
# Send intelligent messages to agents
/sendVibeMessage agent="step-8-agent" message="Generate Phase 3 with user authentication" step="8" priority="high"

# Check agent communications
/checkVibeMessages room="step-8-slices" filter="priority:high"

# Get project status with agent coordination
/getVibeProjectStatus includeMemory=true
```

#### Agent Memory Management
```bash
# Save agent working memory
/saveVibeAgentMemory agentId="step-8-agent" memoryType="project" content="{\"currentPhase\": 3}" step="8"

# Load agent context
/loadVibeAgentMemory agentId="ultrathink-coordinator" memoryType="procedural"
```

#### Agent Coordination
```bash
# Register new agents
/registerVibeAgent agentId="custom-agent" profile="{\"vibeSteps\": [\"step-6\"], \"capabilities\": [\"technical-spec\"]}"

# Find optimal agents for tasks
/findVibeAgentsForTask task="implement authentication system" requiredSteps=["step-8"] preferredCapabilities=["security"]
```

### 4. Integration with Existing Commands

The enhanced system integrates seamlessly with existing Vibe commands:

#### UltraThink Integration
```bash
# UltraThink now coordinates through message bus
/ultrathink "Design authentication system with database integration"

# Enhanced with agent memory and context
# - Architect Agent indexes codebase automatically
# - Context Agent loads project patterns
# - All 5 agents coordinate through persistent bus
# - Results saved to agent memory for future reference
```

#### Multi-Agent Workflows
```bash
# Simplified workflow execution
/orchestrate
> task implement user authentication system

# System automatically:
# 1. Analyzes task for required capabilities
# 2. Routes to research-agent for UltraThink analysis
# 3. Coordinates implementation through coding-agent
# 4. Validates through validation-agent
# 5. All communication persisted and intelligent
```

#### Step Integration
```bash
# Step commands now leverage agent coordination
/vibe-step-8-phase-generation

# Enhanced behavior:
# - Agent loads previous step context from memory
# - Communicates with other agents for dependencies
# - Saves phase context for future coordination
# - Intelligent handoff to next step agents
```
