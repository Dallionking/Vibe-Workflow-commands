### 3. Error Diagnostics
```
🔧 **ERROR DIAGNOSTICS**
=======================

Identified Issues:

❌ Supabase Connection Failed
   Error: Connection timeout after 30s
   Cause: Invalid API key or endpoint
   Solution: Verify credentials in MCP config

⚠️ Linear Rate Limited
   Error: 429 Too Many Requests
   Cause: API rate limit exceeded
   Solution: Reduce request frequency or upgrade plan

⚠️ Sequential-Thinking Slow
   Error: High latency (2.3s average)
   Cause: Possible network or server issues
   Solution: Check network connection or retry later

❌ Digital Ocean Not Configured
   Error: Missing configuration
   Cause: Tool not set up in MCP config
   Solution: Add Digital Ocean MCP configuration
```

### 4. Health Report Generation
```
📋 **MCP HEALTH REPORT**

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Connection Failures
```
🔧 **CONNECTION TROUBLESHOOTING**
==============================

If MCP tool shows "Connection Failed":

1. Check API Keys:
   - Verify credentials in Claude MCP settings
