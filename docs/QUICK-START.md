# Claude Vibe - Quick Start Guide üöÄ

Get up and running with Claude Vibe in under 5 minutes! This guide covers the fastest path to start using the most powerful AI-assisted development system.

## ‚ö° 30-Second Setup

### Prerequisites Check
- ‚úÖ Claude Code Desktop (latest version)
- ‚úÖ Node.js v18+ installed
- ‚úÖ Git configured

### Installation
```bash
# 1. Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/Dallionking/claude-vibe.git
cd claude-vibe
npm install

# 2. Verify installation
npm run doctor

# 3. Import claude.json into Claude Code Desktop
# Settings ‚Üí Developer ‚Üí Import Configuration
```

## üéØ Choose Your Development Style

### Option 1: Traditional Single-Agent (Beginner-Friendly)
Perfect for learning the system and smaller projects.

```bash
# Initialize new project
/vibe-init my-awesome-app

# Start the methodology
/vibe-step-1-ideation

# Check progress anytime
/vibe-status
```

**Next Steps:** Follow prompts through steps 2-10, each building on the previous.

### Option 2: Enhanced Multi-Agent System (Recommended) üÜï
**Virtual agents in your single Claude session** - no multiple terminals needed!

```bash
# One-time setup
cd multi-agent && ./install.sh

# In your Claude session:
/vibe-multi-agent-enhanced

# Use intelligent coordination:
/coordinateUltraThink taskDescription="implement user authentication system"

# Or use legacy multi-terminal approach:
/multi-agent
/orchestrate
```

**What happens:** 5 virtual agents analyze, plan, and coordinate within your session with Mermaid diagrams!

### Option 3: YOLO Maximum Velocity
Execute complete phases with zero prompts while maintaining full quality.

```bash
# Execute complete phases automatically
/yolo local --phase=1 --verbose
/yolo local --phase=2
/yolo docker --phase=3 --rebuild

# Preview what would execute
/yolo local --dry-run --phase=2
```

# In orchestrator terminal:
status                  # Show all agent status
workflow [name]         # Run predefined workflows
task [description]      # Intelligent task breakdown
help                    # Show available commands
```

### YOLO Development
```bash
/yolo local --verbose           # Execute with detailed output
/yolo docker --rebuild          # Fresh container execution
/yolo local --emergency-stop    # Execute with periodic checkpoints
```

## üìä Phase 3 Advanced Features

### Context Engineering

## üí° Pro Tips for Maximum Productivity

1. **Start with Multi-Agent**: It's faster and more powerful than single-agent
2. **Use YOLO for Speed**: When you know what you want, YOLO is unbeatable
3. **Monitor Context**: Run `/context-analyze` regularly for optimal performance
4. **Validate Often**: Use `/re-channel` to catch issues early
5. **Leverage Phase 3**: Let PRP System analyze your code patterns automatically
6. **Batch Commands**: Use orchestrator to coordinate multiple agents efficiently
