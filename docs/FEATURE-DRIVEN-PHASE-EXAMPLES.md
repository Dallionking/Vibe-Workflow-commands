# Feature-Driven Phase Creation Examples

## Overview
The Vibe Coding methodology creates **ONE phase per feature** from the technical specifications. This document shows how dynamic phase creation works based on actual feature count.

## Example 1: SaaS Project with 5 Features

### Technical Specification Features (Section 3.X)
```markdown
Section 3.1: Feature Implementation Priority Matrix
- Phase 1 (MVP): User Authentication, User Profiles, Task Management
- Phase 2 (Enhanced): Team Collaboration, Analytics Dashboard  
- Phase 3 (Advanced): Payment Integration

Section 3.2: User Authentication System
Section 3.3: User Profile Management  
Section 3.4: Task Management System
Section 3.5: Team Collaboration Features
Section 3.6: Analytics Dashboard
```

### Generated Phase Structure
```
Total Features: 5
Total Phases: 6 (Phase 0 + 5 feature phases)

Phase 0: Foundation & Authentication
Phase 1: User Profile Management (from Section 3.3)
Phase 2: Task Management System (from Section 3.4)
Phase 3: Team Collaboration Features (from Section 3.5)

```

### Generated Phase Structure
```
Total Features: 12
Total Phases: 13 (Phase 0 + 12 feature phases)

Phase 0: Foundation & Authentication
Phase 1: Product Catalog System (from Section 3.2)
Phase 2: Shopping Cart Management (from Section 3.3)
Phase 3: User Account System (from Section 3.4)
Phase 4: Order Processing Workflow (from Section 3.5)
Phase 5: Payment Integration (from Section 3.6)
Phase 6: Inventory Management (from Section 3.7)
Phase 7: Product Reviews System (from Section 3.8)

## Example 3: Mobile App with 8 Features

### Technical Specification Features (Section 3.X)
```markdown
Section 3.1: Feature Implementation Priority Matrix
- Phase 1 (MVP): User Registration, Profile Creation, Content Feed, Basic Messaging
- Phase 2 (Enhanced): Media Sharing, Push Notifications, Search, Settings
- Phase 3 (Advanced): None for MVP

Section 3.2: User Registration & Authentication
Section 3.3: User Profile Creation
Section 3.4: Content Feed System
Section 3.5: Messaging System
Section 3.6: Media Sharing Features
Section 3.7: Push Notification System
Section 3.8: Search Functionality
Section 3.9: App Settings & Preferences
```

### Generated Phase Structure
```
Total Features: 8
Total Phases: 9 (Phase 0 + 8 feature phases)

Phase 0: Foundation & Authentication
Phase 1: User Profile Creation (from Section 3.3)
Phase 2: Content Feed System (from Section 3.4)
Phase 3: Messaging System (from Section 3.5)
Phase 4: Media Sharing Features (from Section 3.6)
Phase 5: Push Notification System (from Section 3.7)
Phase 6: Search Functionality (from Section 3.8)
Phase 7: App Settings & Preferences (from Section 3.9)
```

## Key Principles

### 1. Dynamic Phase Count
- **Feature Count = Phase Count** (plus Phase 0 if needed)
- 5 features → 6 phases
- 12 features → 13 phases  
- 20 features → 21 phases
- 50 features → 51 phases

### 2. Feature-Specific Phase Names
- ❌ Generic: "Phase 1. Core Implementation"
- ✅ Specific: "Phase 1. User Profile Management"
- ❌ Generic: "Phase 2. Advanced Features"
- ✅ Specific: "Phase 2. Shopping Cart Management"

### 3. Complete Vertical Slice Per Feature
Each phase includes everything needed for that ONE feature:
- Database schema changes
- API endpoints
- UI components
- Testing and validation
- Integration with existing features

### 4. Feature Mapping from Technical Specification
```
Section 3.2 → Phase 1: [Feature Name from Section 3.2]
Section 3.3 → Phase 2: [Feature Name from Section 3.3]
Section 3.4 → Phase 3: [Feature Name from Section 3.4]
...and so on for all Section 3.X features
```

### 5. Implementation Priority Preserved
- Phase 1 (MVP) features become early phases
- Phase 2 (Enhanced) features become middle phases
- Phase 3 (Advanced) features become later phases

## Sample Phase Structure Detail

### Phase 2: Shopping Cart Management (from Section 3.3)

```markdown
# Phase 2. Shopping Cart Management

## Role & Background
Senior E-Commerce Engineer Profile: 10+ years experience at major e-commerce companies (Amazon, Shopify, BigCommerce), specializing in cart management systems, session handling, and checkout optimization. Expert in real-time inventory updates, cart persistence, and conversion optimization.

## Feature Description
Shopping Cart Management enables users to add products to their cart, modify quantities, save items for later, and proceed to checkout. This feature includes cart persistence across sessions, real-time price updates, inventory validation, and promotional code application as specified in Section 3.3.1.

⚠️ **IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:**
**CRITICAL: Before starting, read these files:**
- current_status.md - Current project state
- known_issues.md - Technical debt
- changelog.md - Change history
- features.md - Feature tracking

## Implementation Tasks:

### Tier 1 Task - Shopping Cart Infrastructure Setup
#### Subtask 1.1: Git Branch Setup
- [ ] Create feature branch: feature/phase-2-shopping-cart-management
- [ ] Initial commit with empty commit

#### Subtask 1.2: Cart Database Schema Setup
- [ ] Use Context7 MCP for e-commerce cart documentation
- [ ] Use Perplexity MCP for cart persistence best practices
- [ ] Create shopping_carts table with schema from Section 3.3.7
- [ ] Create cart_items table with product relationships
- [ ] Set up session management for guest carts

### Tier 2 Task - Core Shopping Cart Implementation
#### Subtask 2.1: Cart Management System
- [ ] Use Shadcn/UI: "Generate shopping cart component using design system from docs/04-design-system.md with add/remove functionality, quantity controls, and price totals based on Section 3.3.2 user stories"
- [ ] Implement cart CRUD API endpoints from Section 3.3.6
- [ ] Create cart persistence logic for both logged-in and guest users
- [ ] Add real-time inventory validation
- [ ] Implement promotional code system

### Tier 3 Task - Shopping Cart Polish & QA
#### Subtask 3.1: Cart Feature Testing & Validation
- [ ] 95%+ test coverage for all cart functionality
- [ ] End-to-end testing for complete cart workflow
- [ ] Performance optimization for cart loading and updates
- [ ] Integration testing with Product Catalog from Phase 1
```

This demonstrates how each phase focuses on ONE complete feature with all necessary implementation details derived from the corresponding Section 3.X specification.
