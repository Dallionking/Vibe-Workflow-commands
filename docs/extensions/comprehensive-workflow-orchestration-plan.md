# Comprehensive Workflow Orchestration Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the complete automation strategy for the Vibe Coding Methodology, orchestrating the entire workflow from project ideation through vertical slice implementation with strategic user interaction points.

## Core Components

### 1. End-to-End Flow Design (Steps 1-10 Automation)

The orchestration system manages the complete Vibe workflow:

```yaml
workflow_steps:
  step_1:
    name: "Project Ideation"
    command: "/vibe-ideation"
    agents: ["project-ideation-agent"]
    output: "project_vision.md"
    
  step_2:
    name: "Technical Architecture"
    command: "/vibe-architecture"
    agents: ["architecture-design-agent", "tech-stack-advisor"]
    output: "technical_architecture.md"
    
  step_3:
    name: "User Experience Design"
    command: "/vibe-ux-design"
    agents: ["ux-research-agent", "user-flow-designer"]
    output: "user_experience_design.md"
    
  step_4:
    name: "Design System"
    command: "/vibe-design-system"
    agents: ["design-system-agent", "component-architect"]
    output: "design_system.md"
    
  step_5:
    name: "User Journey Design"
    command: "/vibe-user-journey"
    agents: ["journey-mapping-agent", "interaction-designer"]
    output: "user_journey_design.md"
    
  step_6:
    name: "Technical Specification"
    command: "/vibe-tech-spec"
    agents: ["spec-writer-agent", "api-designer"]
    output: "technical_specification.md"
    
  step_7:
    name: "Landing Page Creation"
    command: "/vibe-landing-page"
    agents: ["landing-page-designer", "content-strategist"]
    output: "landing_page/"
    
  step_8:
    name: "Vertical Slice Planning"
    command: "/vibe-vertical-slice"
    agents: ["slice-planner", "phase-architect"]
    output: "vertical_slice_plan.md"
    
  step_9:
    name: "Phase Implementation"
    command: "/vibe-implement-phase"
    agents: ["implementation-agent", "code-generator"]
    output: "phase_implementations/"
    
  step_10:
    name: "Integration & Testing"
    command: "/vibe-integrate"
    agents: ["integration-agent", "test-orchestrator"]
    output: "integration_report.md"
```

### 2. Multi-Agent Step Orchestration

For steps requiring multiple agents, the system implements sophisticated coordination:

```yaml
multi_agent_orchestration:
  coordination_modes:
    sequential:
      description: "Agents work in sequence, passing outputs"
      example: "Step 2 - Architecture agent â†’ Tech stack advisor"
      
    parallel:
      description: "Agents work simultaneously on different aspects"
      example: "Step 4 - Design tokens + Component patterns"
      
    collaborative:
      description: "Agents iterate together on shared outputs"
      example: "Step 6 - Spec writer + API designer"
      
  communication_protocol:
    shared_context:
      - project_metadata
      - previous_step_outputs
      - user_preferences
      
    handoff_format:
      status: "complete|partial|blocked"
      output: "structured_data"
      recommendations: "next_actions"
      issues: "blocking_items"
```

### 3. Enhanced Universal Format with UltraThink Integration

The Universal Format now includes UltraThink cognitive enhancement:

```yaml
universal_format_v2:
  metadata:
    version: "2.0"
    cognitive_mode: "ultrathink_enabled"
    
  sections:
    project_context:
      description: "High-level project understanding"
      ultrathink: "Deep pattern analysis and connections"
      
    phase_definition:
      objectives: "Clear phase goals"
      ultrathink: "Strategic implications and dependencies"
      
    technical_requirements:
      specifications: "Detailed technical needs"
      ultrathink: "Architecture decisions and trade-offs"
      
    implementation_guide:
      step_by_step: "Concrete implementation steps"
      ultrathink: "Optimization opportunities and pitfalls"
      
    testing_strategy:
      test_cases: "Comprehensive test scenarios"
      ultrathink: "Edge cases and failure modes"
      
    user_interaction:
      touchpoints: "User interaction requirements"
      ultrathink: "UX implications and flow optimization"
```

### 4. Pre-commit Validation Agent (/vibe-validate-work)

The validation agent ensures quality before any work is committed:

```yaml
validation_agent:
  command: "/vibe-validate-work"
  
  validation_checks:
    code_quality:
      - syntax_validation
      - linting_compliance
      - type_checking
      - security_scanning
      
    architectural_compliance:
      - pattern_adherence
      - dependency_rules
      - module_boundaries
      - api_contracts
      
    documentation_completeness:
      - inline_comments
      - api_documentation
      - readme_updates
      - changelog_entries
      
    test_coverage:
      - unit_test_coverage
      - integration_tests
      - edge_case_handling
      - performance_benchmarks
      
    vibe_methodology:
      - phase_alignment
      - universal_format_compliance
      - agent_handoff_quality
      - user_interaction_points
      
  output_format:
    status: "pass|fail|warning"
    issues:
      - severity: "critical|high|medium|low"
        category: "code|architecture|documentation|testing"
        description: "Issue details"
        suggested_fix: "Remediation steps"
    recommendations: "Improvement suggestions"
```

### 5. Dual Invocation Modes

The system supports both manual and automated invocation:

```yaml
invocation_modes:
  manual_mode:
    description: "User-initiated step-by-step execution"
    commands:
      - "/vibe-step [1-10]"
      - "/vibe-validate-work"
      - "/vibe-review-output"
    benefits:
      - "Full user control"
      - "Review at each step"
      - "Custom modifications"
      
  automated_mode:
    description: "Full workflow automation with checkpoints"
    command: "/vibe-auto-workflow"
    configuration:
      pause_points:
        - after_step_3: "UX design review"
        - after_step_6: "Technical spec approval"
        - after_step_8: "Vertical slice review"
      error_handling:
        - retry_attempts: 3
        - fallback_to_manual: true
        - notification_channels: ["console", "log"]
    benefits:
      - "Rapid execution"
      - "Consistent output"
      - "Unattended operation"
```

### 6. Strategic User Interaction Points

The system identifies key moments for user input:

```yaml
interaction_points:
  mandatory_reviews:
    project_vision:
      step: 1
      purpose: "Confirm project direction"
      actions: ["approve", "modify", "restart"]
      
    ux_design:
      step: 3
      purpose: "Validate user experience approach"
      actions: ["approve", "iterate", "pivot"]
      
    technical_specification:
      step: 6
      purpose: "Approve technical decisions"
      actions: ["approve", "refine", "escalate"]
      
  optional_checkpoints:
    design_system:
      step: 4
      trigger: "complexity_threshold"
      
    vertical_slice:
      step: 8
      trigger: "risk_assessment"
      
  real_time_feedback:
    mechanism: "streaming_output"
    interventions:
      - pause_execution
      - modify_parameters
      - inject_context
```

### 7. Document Compilation Strategy

The system intelligently compiles outputs into cohesive documentation:

```yaml
compilation_strategy:
  document_types:
    project_documentation:
      structure:
        - executive_summary
        - technical_overview
        - implementation_guide
        - api_reference
        - deployment_instructions
      format: "markdown_with_diagrams"
      
    developer_guide:
      structure:
        - quick_start
        - architecture_deep_dive
        - code_examples
        - troubleshooting
      format: "interactive_documentation"
      
    phase_documentation:
      structure:
        - phase_overview
        - requirements
        - implementation_steps
        - testing_procedures
        - integration_points
      format: "universal_phase_format"
      
  compilation_rules:
    cross_referencing:
      - automatic_linking
      - dependency_mapping
      - version_tracking
      
    consistency_checks:
      - terminology_alignment
      - format_standardization
      - completeness_validation
      
  output_generation:
    formats:
      - markdown: "Primary documentation"
      - json: "Machine-readable specs"
      - html: "Interactive guides"
      - pdf: "Print-ready documents"
```
