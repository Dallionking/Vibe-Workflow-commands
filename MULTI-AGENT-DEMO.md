# Multi-Agent System Demo

## Fixed Architecture - Now Actually Works!

This demo shows the **corrected multi-agent system** that works with Claude Code's actual capabilities, instead of assuming features that don't exist.

## The Problem with the Original Implementation

❌ **What Didn't Work:**
- Assumed Claude Code supported multi-instance coordination
- Expected `/agent research-agent --terminal-id=2` to magically work
- Built interfaces without implementing the underlying communication layer
- No real file monitoring or agent-to-agent communication

## The Solution - Real Multi-Agent System

✅ **What Actually Works:**
- External wrapper scripts that monitor file changes
- Real CLI orchestrator for task coordination
- Actual file-based communication between processes
- Agent guidance that works with Claude Code tools

## How to Run the Demo

### Step 1: Start the Orchestrator
```bash
# Terminal 1
node multi-agent/core/simple-orchestrator.js
```

This starts an interactive CLI where you can:
- Assign tasks to agents
- Check agent status
- Monitor system health

### Step 2: Start Agent Instances

```bash
# Terminal 2 - Research Agent
./multi-agent/scripts/start-research-agent.sh

# Terminal 3 - Coding Agent  
./multi-agent/scripts/start-coding-agent.sh

# Terminal 4 - Testing Agent
./multi-agent/scripts/start-testing-agent.sh
```

Each script:
- Starts a wrapper that monitors `.workflow/context/channel.md`
- Announces agent ready status
- Provides real-time task detection
- Gives specific guidance for manual execution

### Step 3: Assign Tasks and See Real Coordination

In the orchestrator terminal:

```bash
orchestrator> task research-agent Analyze React patterns in the src/ directory
orchestrator> task coding-agent Create a UserCard component with TypeScript
orchestrator> task testing-agent Write comprehensive tests for UserCard
orchestrator> status
```

## What You'll See

### 1. Agent Registration
When agents start, they automatically announce themselves:

```markdown
### [2025-07-13T08:30:00.000Z] research-agent
**Type:** agent-ready
**Target:** orchestrator

🤖 research-agent is ready
**Role:** research-agent
**Capabilities:** pattern analysis, documentation review, codebase exploration
```

### 2. Task Assignment
The orchestrator writes task assignments to the channel:

```markdown
### [2025-07-13T08:31:00.000Z] orchestrator
**Type:** task-assignment
**Target:** research-agent

**Task:** Analyze React patterns in the src/ directory
**Instructions:**
- Read the task description carefully
- Execute using Claude Code tools
- Report back with results
```

### 3. Agent Response with Guidance
Agents detect tasks and provide specific guidance:

```markdown
### [2025-07-13T08:31:30.000Z] research-agent
**Type:** task-complete
**Target:** orchestrator

✅ Task Completed Successfully
**Task:** Analyze React patterns in the src/ directory
**Approach:** Codebase analysis task detected - examining patterns
**Tools Used:** Grep, LS, Read, WebSearch

**Guidance Provided:**
1. Use Grep to search for React patterns
2. Use LS to understand directory structure  
3. Use Read to examine key files
4. Compile findings into analysis
```

### 4. Real-Time Status Updates
The orchestrator shows live agent status:

```bash
orchestrator> status

📊 Agent Status Report
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
research-agent       ready      2 tasks   Last seen: 15s ago
coding-agent         ready      1 tasks   Last seen: 30s ago  
testing-agent        ready      0 tasks   Last seen: 45s ago
```

## Key Features That Actually Work

### ✅ Real File Monitoring
- Uses `chokidar` for actual file watching
- Detects changes to `.workflow/context/channel.md`
- Processes new messages in real-time

### ✅ Agent Specialization
Each agent provides role-specific guidance:

- **Research Agent**: Pattern analysis, codebase exploration
- **Coding Agent**: Component creation, feature implementation  
- **Testing Agent**: Test creation, quality validation

### ✅ Tool Integration Guidance
Agents suggest specific Claude Code tools:

```javascript
// Research Agent suggests:
tools: ['Grep', 'LS', 'Read', 'WebSearch']

// Coding Agent suggests:  
tools: ['Read', 'Write', 'Edit', 'MultiEdit']

// Testing Agent suggests:
tools: ['Read', 'Write', 'Bash']
```

### ✅ Graceful Error Handling
- Agents continue running if file access fails
- Orchestrator handles missing agents gracefully
- Clear error messages and recovery suggestions

## Technical Architecture

### File Structure
```
multi-agent/
├── core/
│   ├── simple-orchestrator.js    # Interactive CLI coordinator
│   └── agent-wrapper.js          # Agent monitoring wrapper
└── scripts/
    ├── start-research-agent.sh   # Research agent launcher
    ├── start-coding-agent.sh     # Coding agent launcher
    └── start-testing-agent.sh    # Testing agent launcher
```

### Communication Flow
```
Orchestrator → channel.md → Agent Wrapper → Guidance
     ↑                                           ↓
Status Updates ← channel.md ← Agent Response ←──┘
```

### Data Format
```markdown
### [timestamp] agent-name
**Type:** message-type
**Target:** recipient

Message content with structured data
```

## Demonstration Script

Here's a complete demo session:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start orchestrator
node multi-agent/core/simple-orchestrator.js

# Terminal 2: Start research agent
./multi-agent/scripts/start-research-agent.sh

# Terminal 3: Start coding agent
./multi-agent/scripts/start-coding-agent.sh

# In orchestrator:
orchestrator> agents     # List available agents
orchestrator> task research-agent Find all React components
orchestrator> task coding-agent Create UserProfile component  
orchestrator> status     # Check agent progress
orchestrator> help       # Show available commands
orchestrator> quit       # Clean shutdown
```

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Actually Works**: Uses real file monitoring and process coordination
2. **Guidance-Based**: Provides specific steps for manual execution
3. **Tool-Aware**: Suggests appropriate Claude Code tools for each task
4. **Scalable**: Easy to add new agent types and capabilities
5. **Debuggable**: Clear message flow and error handling
6. **Real-Time**: Immediate response to task assignments

## Comparison: Before vs After

### Before (Broken)
```bash
/agent research-agent --terminal-id=2  # ❌ Doesn't work
/orchestrate                           # ❌ Fake automation
```

### After (Working)
```bash
node multi-agent/core/simple-orchestrator.js        # ✅ Real CLI
./multi-agent/scripts/start-research-agent.sh       # ✅ Real wrapper
orchestrator> task research-agent Analyze codebase  # ✅ Real coordination
```

## Future Enhancements

This foundation enables:
- Integration with actual Claude Code API calls
- Automated task execution (when technically feasible)
- Advanced workflow orchestration
- Team collaboration features
- Performance monitoring and optimization

The key insight: **Build what's actually possible**, then enhance from there, rather than documenting imaginary capabilities.
