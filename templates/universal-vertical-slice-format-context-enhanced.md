# Context-Enhanced Universal Vertical Slice Phase Documentation Format Template

## Overview
This template integrates Context Engineering with the existing UltraThink planning automation and pre-commit validation agents. It adds intelligent context awareness, pattern learning, and adaptive code generation while maintaining the powerful automation features already in place.

## Key Enhancements (Building on Existing Features)
1. **Context Assembly Layer** - Loads project-specific patterns before UltraThink planning
2. **Pattern-Aware PRPs** - UltraThink receives YOUR codebase patterns automatically
3. **Learned Context Integration** - Validation agent checks pattern compliance
4. **Context Memory Updates** - System learns from each phase completion
5. **UI Healer Integration** - Automated UI quality enhancement throughout the workflow

## Template Usage Instructions

### 1. Copy Template Structure
