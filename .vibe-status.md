## Next Actions

### Phase 1 Finalization
1. **Commit Phase 1 Work**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: complete Phase 1 - Context Engineering Foundation"
   ```

### Phase 2 Implementation
2. **Start Tier 1: Enhanced Pattern Intelligence**
   ```bash
   # Create retrofit directory structure
   mkdir -p context/retrofit/{pattern-memory,learning,cache}
   mkdir -p templates/retrofit-patterns
   mkdir -p validation/retrofit
   ```

3. **Test Phase 1 Foundation**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm test
   npm run doctor
   ```

4. **Begin Phase 2 Development**
   ```bash
   # Implement pattern memory system
   # Create learning adapter
   # Build template library
   ```

## Notes

### Architecture Decisions
- TypeScript for type safety
- Jest for testing framework
- Layered context architecture
- Performance-first design
- Graceful degradation

### Key Innovations
- Dynamic context assembly based on runtime state
- Pattern learning from codebase
- Token optimization without quality loss
- Integrated validation throughout
- Real-time performance monitoring
