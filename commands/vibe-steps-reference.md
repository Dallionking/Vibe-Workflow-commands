# Vibe Steps Command Reference

## Overview
The Vibe Coding methodology consists of 10 sequential steps. This reference documents the planned commands for each step.

## Status
ðŸš§ **UNDER DEVELOPMENT** ðŸš§

Currently, only `/vibe-feature-ideate` is fully implemented. The step-specific commands are planned for future releases.

## Step Commands

### /vibe-step-1 - Project Ideation
- **Alias**: `/vibe-project-ideate`
- **Status**: Under development
- **Purpose**: Full project ideation and planning
- **Workaround**: Use `/vibe-feature-ideate` for core features

### /vibe-step-2 - Project Initialization

- **Status**: Planned
- **Purpose**: Configure development environment
- **Workaround**: Manual environment configuration

### /vibe-step-4 - Implementation of Core Logic
- **Status**: Planned
- **Purpose**: Implement business logic and models
- **Workaround**: Use implementation plan from `/vibe-feature-ideate`

### /vibe-step-5 - User Interface Creation
- **Status**: Planned
- **Purpose**: Build UI components and pages

### /vibe-step-10 - Deployment
- **Status**: Planned
- **Purpose**: Deploy to production
- **Workaround**: Follow phase 7 from feature ideation output

## Integration with Feature Ideation

The `/vibe-feature-ideate` command generates output that maps to these steps:
- **Phase 1 (Planning)** â†’ Step 1
- **Phase 2 (Foundation)** â†’ Steps 2-3
- **Phase 3 (Core Logic)** â†’ Step 4
- **Phase 4 (UI)** â†’ Step 5
- **Phase 5 (Integration)** â†’ Step 6
- **Phase 6 (Testing)** â†’ Step 7
- **Phase 7 (Deployment)** â†’ Steps 8-10

## Future Development

These commands will be implemented to provide:
- Automated workflow progression
- Context preservation between steps
- Integration with existing tools
- Progress tracking and reporting
