# vibe-ideate-feature

AI-powered feature ideation and planning using multi-agent collaboration for comprehensive feature development.

## Usage
```
/vibe-ideate-feature <feature-description>
```

## Parameters
- `feature-description` - Description of the feature you want to ideate

## Process
The feature ideation system orchestrates multiple specialized agents:

1. **Research Agent**
   - Market research and competitor analysis
   - Best practices and implementation patterns
   - Technology recommendations

2. **Architecture Analyst**
   - System design and integration points
   - Technical feasibility assessment
   - Performance and scalability considerations

3. **Clarification Agent**
   - Identifies ambiguities and unknowns
   - Generates clarifying questions
   - Refines requirements

4. **Documentation Agent**
   - Fetches relevant documentation
   - Analyzes existing patterns
   - Provides implementation examples

5. **Planning Synthesizer**
   - Combines all agent insights
   - Creates comprehensive feature plan
   - Generates implementation phases

## Output
- **Feature Specification**: Complete feature definition
- **Architecture Design**: Technical architecture and integration
- **Implementation Plan**: Phased development approach
- **Risk Assessment**: Identified risks and mitigation
- **Resource Requirements**: Team and technology needs

## Examples
```bash
# Basic feature ideation
/vibe-ideate-feature "Add real-time collaborative editing to our document platform"

# E-commerce feature
/vibe-ideate-feature "Implement AI-powered product recommendations with personalization"

# Infrastructure feature
/vibe-ideate-feature "Add multi-region deployment with automatic failover"
```

## Integration
