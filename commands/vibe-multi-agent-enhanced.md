# vibe-multi-agent-enhanced

Initialize enhanced MCP-native multi-agent system with intelligent coordination. This creates virtual agents within your single Claude Code session using SQLite-based persistent communication.

## Usage
```
/vibe-multi-agent-enhanced
```

## Key Features
- Single-command setup (replaces complex multi-terminal orchestration)
- SQLite-based persistence (no file-watching race conditions)
- Cross-session persistence (agents remember context)
- Intelligent routing (messages go to appropriate agents automatically)
- Zero manual coordination required

## Virtual Agents Created
- **Architect Agent**: System design, codebase analysis, Mermaid diagrams
- **Research Agent**: Uses Context7/Perplexity for documentation
- **Coder Agent**: Implementation planning and code structure
- **Testing Agent**: Validation strategies, ensures 95%+ coverage
- **Context Agent**: Pattern analysis and consistency checking

## Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Claude Desktop with MCP support
- Run `cd multi-agent && ./install.sh` for one-time setup

## Related Commands
- `/coordinateUltraThink` - 5-agent coordination with diagrams
- `/sendVibeMessage` - Send messages to specific agents
- `/getVibeProjectStatus` - Check system status

## Example
```
/vibe-multi-agent-enhanced
# System initializes and registers all virtual agents
# You can then use other multi-agent commands
```
