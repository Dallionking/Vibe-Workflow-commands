‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:**

**CRITICAL: Before starting any tasks, read these files to understand current project state:**
- `current_status.md` - Current project state and active features
- `known_issues.md` - Existing bugs and technical debt  
- `changelog.md` - All previous changes and updates
- `features.md` - Completed, in-progress, and planned features
- `CONTEXT-ENGINEERING-STATUS.md` - Phase 1 & 2 completion status

1. Check off each subtask with [x] as you complete it
2. Do not proceed to the next task until ALL checkboxes in the current task are marked complete
3. Ensure Phase 1 & 2 infrastructure is fully operational
4. Use Context7 MCP to fetch up-to-date documentation before starting each subtask
5. Use Perplexity MCP for any research needs or best practices
6. **NEW**: UltraThink planning is automatically invoked for each major subtask
7. **NEW**: Pre-commit validation agent runs before all Git operations
