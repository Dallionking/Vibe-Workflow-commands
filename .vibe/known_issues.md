- **Status**: Documented but not implemented
- **Estimated Fix Time**: 2 hours
- **Priority**: Medium (can be deferred to v1.1)

#### 6. Performance Monitoring Gaps
- **Issue**: No runtime performance metrics collection
- **Impact**: Cannot identify performance bottlenecks or optimization opportunities
- **Current State**: Basic timing measurements only
- **Status**: Planned for future release
- **Estimated Implementation**: 3 hours
- **Priority**: Medium (v1.1 feature)

### Low Priority Issues

#### 7. Template Customization Complexity
- **Issue**: Project templates require manual customization for edge cases
- **Impact**: Additional setup time for non-standard project types
- **Current Workaround**: Manual editing of generated templates
- **Status**: Acceptable for v1.0
- **Future Enhancement**: Template marketplace and custom template generation

#### 8. Error Message Clarity
- **Issue**: Some error messages could be more specific about resolution steps
- **Impact**: Increased troubleshooting time for users
- **Examples**: MCP authentication failures, permission errors
- **Status**: Acceptable for v1.0
- **Future Enhancement**: Enhanced error reporting with specific remediation steps

## Technical Debt

### Architecture Debt

#### 1. Agent Interdependency Management
- **Debt**: Agents have implicit dependencies that aren't systematically managed
- **Impact**: Potential issues when running agents out of sequence
- **Current Mitigation**: Clear documentation of prerequisites
- **Refactoring Needed**: Explicit dependency validation system
- **Effort Required**: 4 hours
- **Priority**: Low (works well with current documentation)

#### 2. Configuration Centralization
- **Debt**: Some configuration scattered across multiple files
- **Impact**: Maintenance complexity when updating settings
- **Current State**: Manageable with current system size
- **Refactoring Needed**: Centralized configuration management
- **Effort Required**: 3 hours
- **Priority**: Low (not critical for current functionality)

### Code Quality Debt

#### 3. Agent Documentation Consistency
- **Debt**: Some agent files have minor formatting inconsistencies
- **Impact**: Minor - doesn't affect functionality
- **Examples**: Inconsistent markdown formatting, minor style variations
- **Refactoring Needed**: Automated formatting validation
- **Effort Required**: 1 hour
- **Priority**: Very Low

#### 4. MCP Integration Error Handling
- **Debt**: MCP error handling could be more comprehensive
- **Impact**: Some edge cases may not be handled gracefully
- **Current State**: Basic error handling implemented
- **Enhancement Needed**: Comprehensive error scenarios and recovery
- **Effort Required**: 2 hours
- **Priority**: Low (current implementation is functional)

### Documentation Debt

#### 5. Example Project Implementation
- **Debt**: No complete end-to-end example project demonstrating full workflow
- **Impact**: Users may need to experiment to understand complete process
- **Current State**: Individual step examples available
- **Enhancement Needed**: Complete sample project implementation
- **Effort Required**: 6 hours
- **Priority**: Medium (valuable for user adoption)

#### 6. Troubleshooting Guide Expansion
- **Debt**: Troubleshooting guides could cover more edge cases
- **Impact**: Users may need to contact support for uncommon issues
- **Current State**: Common issues well documented
- **Enhancement Needed**: Expanded troubleshooting scenarios
- **Effort Required**: 2 hours
- **Priority**: Low (current documentation covers 90% of cases)
