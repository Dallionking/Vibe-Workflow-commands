# Multi-Agent Setup Instructions - Phase 2 Focus

## ðŸš€ Phase 2 Optimized Multi-Agent Team

### Required Terminals (4 total)

**Terminal 1 - ORCHESTRATOR (Main Control)**
```bash
/orchestrate
```
*This is your command center. You'll manage tasks and coordinate the team from here.*

**Terminal 2 - RESEARCH AGENT**  
```bash
/agent research-agent --terminal-id=2
```
*Handles UltraThink analysis, Context7 research, and Perplexity queries for Phase 2 tasks.*

**Terminal 3 - CODING AGENT**
```bash
/agent coding-agent --terminal-id=3  
```
*Implements pattern recognition engine, context layers, and adaptive systems.*

**Terminal 4 - TESTING AGENT**
```bash
/agent testing-agent --terminal-id=4
```
*Validates pattern accuracy, runs comprehensive tests, ensures 95%+ coverage.*

## ðŸŽ¯ Phase 2 Specialized Workflows

### Immediate Phase 2 Tasks Ready for Multi-Agent:
1. **Git Branch Setup** (Subtask 1.1) - Ready now
2. **UltraThink Pattern Analysis** (Subtask 1.2) - Research + Coding collaboration
3. **Context Layers Implementation** (Subtask 1.3) - Full team coordination
4. **Enhanced Analyzer** (Subtask 2.1) - Coding + Testing focus

### Example Commands for Orchestrator:
```bash
task Setup git branch for Phase 2 development
task Run UltraThink analysis for pattern recognition engine  
task Implement pattern detection infrastructure
workflow phase-2-development
```

## ðŸ”„ Communication Flow
- All agents monitor `.workflow/context/channel.md`
- Phase 2 context is automatically loaded
- Progress tracked against phase checkboxes
- Git checkpoints coordinated across team

## âœ… Success Indicators
- All 4 agents show "connected and ready"
- Channel.md displays active agent status
- Phase 2 tasks appear in orchestrator task queue
- File monitoring active for retrofit/ directory

Ready to revolutionize your Phase 2 development! ðŸš€
