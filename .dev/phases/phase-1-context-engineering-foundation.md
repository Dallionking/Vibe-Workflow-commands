# Phase 1. Context Engineering Foundation

## Role & Background
**Senior FANG Engineer Profile**: 10+ years experience at major tech companies (Google, Facebook, Amazon, Netflix), specializing in AI/ML infrastructure, developer tools, and context management systems. Expert in language model optimization, prompt engineering evolution, multi-agent architectures, and building scalable developer platforms. Experienced in TypeScript, Node.js, AI/ML frameworks, and creating intelligent code generation systems with advanced context awareness.

## Feature Description
Implement the foundational context engineering layer for the Vibe Coding system, transforming it from a linear command system to an intelligent, context-aware development platform. This phase establishes the core infrastructure for layered context management, dynamic context assembly, and intelligent pattern recognition that will enhance all existing commands and enable advanced features in subsequent phases.

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:**

**CRITICAL: Before starting any tasks, read these files to understand current project state:**
- `current_status.md` - Current project state and active features
- `known_issues.md` - Existing bugs and technical debt  
- `changelog.md` - All previous changes and updates
- `features.md` - Completed, in-progress, and planned features

1. Check off each subtask with [x] as you complete it
2. Do not proceed to the next task until ALL checkboxes in the current task are marked complete
3. Reference `CONTEXT-ENGINEERING-INSIGHTS.md` for architectural decisions
4. Reference `CONTEXT-ENGINEERING-RETROFIT.md` for retrofit-specific patterns
5. Use Context7 MCP to fetch up-to-date documentation before starting each subtask
6. Use Perplexity MCP for any research needs or best practices
7. **NEW**: UltraThink planning is automatically invoked for each major subtask
8. **NEW**: Pre-commit validation agent runs before all Git operations
