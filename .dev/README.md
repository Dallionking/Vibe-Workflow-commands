# Development Files

This `.dev/` folder contains internal development tracking and planning documents that are not part of the public Claude Vibe package.

## Contents

- **Status Tracking**: `current_status.md`, `changelog.md`, `features.md`
- **Phase Documentation**: `phases/` folder with implementation plans
- **Analysis Documents**: Various research and planning docs
- **Internal Planning**: Development roadmaps and technical specifications

## For Developers

These files track the development process and contain detailed implementation notes. They are hidden from end users to keep the public package clean and focused.

## For Users

If you're installing Claude Vibe, you don't need anything in this folder. All user-facing documentation is in the main project directory.
