# Context Engineering for Retrofit Commands

## Why Context Engineering is PERFECT for Retrofitting

Retrofitting existing codebases is inherently more complex than starting fresh because you must:
1. **Understand existing patterns** without breaking them
2. **Preserve working code** while improving it
3. **Maintain backwards compatibility**
4. **Work with incomplete or missing documentation**
5. **Navigate technical debt** carefully

Context engineering solves these challenges by creating intelligent, adaptive context layers that understand and respect existing code.

## Enhanced Retrofit Context Architecture

### 1. **Discovery Context Layer**
The retrofit process would use progressive context discovery:

```markdown
## L0: Codebase Discovery Context
- Detected patterns and conventions
- Existing architecture decisions
- Current tech stack and versions
- Team coding styles

## L1: Preservation Context
- Working features to protect
- Critical business logic
- External dependencies
- Integration points

## L2: Improvement Context
- Technical debt locations
- Performance bottlenecks
- Missing test coverage
- Security vulnerabilities

## L3: Evolution Context
- Desired end state
- Migration strategy
- Compatibility requirements
- Risk mitigation
```

### 2. **Pattern Recognition Context**
Enhanced pattern detection using context engineering:

```javascript
// Context-aware pattern analyzer
const patternContext = {
  detected: {
    components: {
      pattern: "React Functional Components",
      examples: [...actualCodeExamples],
      conventions: {
        naming: "PascalCase",
        hooks: "useState, useEffect patterns",
        props: "destructured, typed"
      }
    },
    stateManagement: {
      pattern: "Redux Toolkit",
      examples: [...sliceExamples],
      conventions: {
        slices: "feature-based",
        selectors: "memoized",
        actions: "createAsyncThunk"
      }
    }
  },
  // This context informs ALL future generation
  generationRules: generateFromDetectedPatterns()
}
```

### 3. **Retrofit-Specific PRPs**
Product Requirements Prompts tailored for existing code:

```markdown
# Retrofit PRP: Feature Enhancement

## Existing Context
- Current implementation: [analyzed code]
- Working correctly: [what to preserve]
- Issues identified: [what to fix]
- Dependencies: [what it connects to]

## Enhancement Blueprint
- Minimal changes for maximum impact
- Preserve all working functionality
- Match existing patterns exactly
- Add only what's missing

## Validation Gates
- [ ] No regression in existing features
- [ ] Maintains current API contracts
- [ ] Follows detected code patterns
- [ ] Passes all existing tests
- [ ] Adds new tests for changes
```

### 4. **Incremental Context Loading**
Smart context that loads based on what you're retrofitting:

```yaml
retrofit_context_loader:
  analyze_scope:
    - current_file
    - immediate_dependencies
    - related_features
    - test_coverage
  
  load_relevant_context:
    - existing_patterns_in_scope
    - related_documentation
    - historical_changes
    - team_conventions
  
  generate_focused_context:
    - specific_to_current_task
    - respects_boundaries
    - maintains_compatibility
```

### 5. **Living Context Memory**
The retrofit system learns as it goes:

```json
{
  "retrofit_memory": {
    "discovered_patterns": {
      "authentication": "JWT with refresh tokens",
      "error_handling": "centralized error boundary",
      "data_fetching": "RTK Query pattern"
    },
    "team_preferences": {
      "avoided_patterns": ["class components", "direct DOM manipulation"],
      "preferred_libraries": ["@mui/material", "date-fns", "lodash"]
    },
    "successful_refactors": [
      {
        "pattern": "useState to useReducer",
        "context": "complex form state",
        "outcome": "improved maintainability"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Retrofit Command Enhancements

### 1. **Enhanced vibe-analyze-codebase**
With context engineering:

```bash
/vibe-analyze-codebase --context-depth=deep --pattern-learning=enabled
```

Would create:
```markdown
## Codebase Context Profile

### Discovered Architecture Layers
- Presentation: React + TypeScript
- State: Redux Toolkit
- API: Express + PostgreSQL
- Testing: Jest + RTL

### Pattern Library
[Actual code examples from YOUR codebase organized by pattern]

### Context Rules Extracted
1. Always use functional components
2. Prefer hooks over HOCs
3. Use TypeScript strictly
4. Test coverage minimum 80%

### Anti-patterns Detected
- Avoid direct state mutation
- No inline styles
- No any types without comment
```

### 2. **Enhanced vibe-retrofit-existing**
With progressive context assembly:

```bash
/vibe-retrofit-existing --context-mode=adaptive --validation-gates=strict
```

The system would:
1. Build context from existing code
2. Generate agents that match YOUR patterns
3. Create PRPs that respect YOUR architecture
4. Validate against YOUR standards

### 3. **New Command: vibe-retrofit-context**
Specific context management for retrofits:

```bash
/vibe-retrofit-context learn     # Learn patterns from existing code
/vibe-retrofit-context apply     # Apply learned patterns to new code
/vibe-retrofit-context validate  # Ensure consistency with existing patterns
/vibe-retrofit-context export    # Export context for team sharing
```

## Retrofit-Specific Context Features

### 1. **Compatibility Context Layer**
```markdown
## Compatibility Requirements
- Node version: 14.x (detected)
- Browser support: IE11+ (from babel config)
- API versions: v1 must be maintained
- Database: PostgreSQL 12.x features only
```

### 2. **Migration Context Paths**
```markdown
## Safe Migration Paths
From: Class Components
To: Functional Components
Context: [Examples from YOUR codebase showing the pattern]
Validation: [Tests that ensure behavior is preserved]
```

### 3. **Team Knowledge Context**
```markdown
## Team Context
- Senior developers know: Redux, React
- Team is learning: TypeScript, Testing
- Avoid introducing: GraphQL (not ready)
- Preferred tools: VS Code, ESLint config
```

## Implementation Strategy for Retrofit Context

### Phase 1: Context Discovery
```javascript
// Automated context building from existing code
const contextDiscovery = {
  scanCodebase: () => {
    // Detect all patterns
    // Extract conventions
    // Build context layers
  },
  generateContextProfile: () => {
    // Create comprehensive context
    // Include examples
    // Set validation rules
  }
}
```

### Phase 2: Context-Aware Generation
```javascript
// All generation uses discovered context
const contextAwareGeneration = {
  beforeGenerate: (task) => {
    // Load relevant context
    // Apply patterns
    // Set constraints
  },
  generate: (prompt) => {
    // Include context in prompt
    // Validate against patterns
    // Ensure compatibility
  },
  afterGenerate: (code) => {
    // Validate matches patterns
    // Check compatibility
    // Update context memory
  }
}
```

### Phase 3: Continuous Context Learning
```javascript
// System learns from every interaction
const contextLearning = {
  captureSuccess: (pattern) => {
    // Add to successful patterns
    // Update generation rules
  },
  captureFailure: (issue) => {
    // Add to anti-patterns
    // Adjust validation gates
  },
  evolveContext: () => {
    // Refine patterns over time
    // Improve accuracy
  }
}
```

## Benefits for Retrofit Projects

- Knowledge captured and shared

## Example: Retrofitting with Context Engineering

### Before Context Engineering:
```bash
/vibe-retrofit-existing
# Generic patterns applied
# May not match your code style
# Requires extensive review
```

### With Context Engineering:
```bash
/vibe-retrofit-existing --context-mode=adaptive
# Learns YOUR patterns first
# Generates matching code
# Validates compatibility
# Preserves everything working
```

## Conclusion

Context engineering transforms retrofit commands from generic tools into intelligent assistants that:
1. **Understand** your existing codebase deeply
2. **Respect** your patterns and conventions
3. **Preserve** what's working
4. **Improve** what needs enhancement
5. **Generate** code that fits perfectly

This isn't just retrofittingâ€”it's intelligent code evolution that maintains the soul of your project while upgrading its capabilities.
